# Description of the Task


(Jupyter Notebook Workflow)

The Jupyter Notebook you've executed focuses on a data preprocessing pipeline applied to a dataset about rural population percentages across various countries. This pipeline is implemented using Python's powerful libraries such as **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and related modules for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the notebook’s contents:

1. **Data Importation**:
   The process starts with reading a CSV file named `rural_population_percent.csv`, located on the local machine. The dataset appears to have additional metadata in the first few rows, as indicated by the use of `skiprows=4`. The dataset is then loaded into a DataFrame named `df`, and its shape is printed to understand the number of rows and columns.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   The next step involves cleaning the dataset by removing rows and columns that contain only `NaN` values. This is done using `dropna()` with appropriate arguments. This helps in reducing noise and ensuring that only relevant data is used for further analysis.

3. **Feature Separation**:
   Columns are separated into two types: categorical and numerical.

   * **Categorical Columns** include: `Country Name`, `Country Code`, `Indicator Name`, and `Indicator Code`.
   * All other columns (likely representing year-wise population data) are treated as **numerical**.

4. **Categorical Encoding**:
   Label encoding is applied to all categorical columns using Scikit-learn’s `LabelEncoder`. This transforms categorical strings into numerical labels so that they can be used in machine learning models or statistical analysis. Each label encoder is stored in a dictionary for future use or reference.

5. **Numerical Preprocessing Pipeline**:
   A **Scikit-learn pipeline** is created for handling numerical columns. This pipeline consists of two steps:

   * **Imputation** using `SimpleImputer`, which replaces missing values with the mean of each column.
   * **Scaling** using `StandardScaler`, which normalizes the numerical data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

6. **Applying ColumnTransformer**:
   A `ColumnTransformer` is defined to apply the numeric pipeline specifically to numerical columns. This modular approach ensures reusability and clean separation of preprocessing logic.

7. **Transformation and Combination**:
   The numerical features are transformed using the defined pipeline and converted back into a DataFrame. Then, both the processed categorical and numerical DataFrames are combined using `pd.concat()` to form a complete preprocessed dataset.

8. **Output and Saving**:
   The final processed DataFrame is saved to the same file path (overwriting the original CSV). The shape and a sample of the processed dataset are printed to confirm successful preprocessing.
