# Description of the Task


# Data Preprocessing Workflow in Jupyter Notebook**

The Jupyter Notebook titled `task 1.ipynb` outlines a structured and methodical data preprocessing workflow for a dataset containing information on rural population percentages across various countries. The primary goal of this notebook is to prepare the dataset for further analysis or machine learning tasks by cleaning, transforming, and encoding the data efficiently.

The process begins with importing essential Python libraries such as `pandas` for data manipulation and `scikit-learn` for preprocessing. The dataset is read from a CSV file named `rural_population_percent.csv`, located in a local directory. The use of `skiprows=4` suggests that the dataset has metadata or headers in the first few rows that need to be skipped before actual data processing begins. Once loaded into a DataFrame (`df`), the shape of the dataset is printed to understand the number of entries and features available.

The first major step in the data preprocessing process involves data cleaning. The notebook removes any rows or columns that are completely empty using `dropna()` with appropriate parameters (`how='all'`). This helps eliminate irrelevant or empty data and ensures that only valid entries are processed in subsequent steps.

Following the cleaning process, the dataset is divided into **categorical** and **numerical** features. Categorical columns include `Country Name`, `Country Code`, `Indicator Name`, and `Indicator Code`, which are primarily textual data. All remaining columns, assumed to represent year-wise rural population percentages, are classified as numerical features.

To make the categorical data suitable for machine learning models, **label encoding** is applied using Scikit-learnâ€™s `LabelEncoder`. Each categorical column is transformed into numerical form, and the encoders used are stored in a dictionary for potential reuse, ensuring consistency and traceability.

Next, the numerical data undergoes a robust transformation pipeline built using Scikit-learn's `Pipeline` object. This pipeline consists of two key preprocessing steps:

1. **Imputation**: Missing values are handled using the `SimpleImputer` with a strategy to replace them with the mean of their respective columns.
2. **Scaling**: The `StandardScaler` is applied to normalize the numerical data so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.

These transformations are then applied selectively to the numerical columns using a `ColumnTransformer`. The transformed numerical data is converted back into a DataFrame for easier integration.

Finally, the notebook concatenates the processed categorical and numerical data into a single DataFrame called `df_processed`. This fully processed data is then saved back into a CSV file, overwriting the original file path. The shape of the processed data and a preview of the first few rows are displayed, confirming successful completion of preprocessing.

In conclusion, this notebook demonstrates a well-structured data preprocessing pipeline using Jupyter Notebook. It includes essential steps such as data cleaning, encoding, transformation, and integration. This structured approach ensures that the dataset is clean, consistent, and ready for modeling or further statistical analysis.
